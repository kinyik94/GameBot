Methods:

    move(): the bot goes ahead one field
    turn(direction): turn to the specified direction
        direction can be "left" or "right"
        Example: turn(left) -> the bot turns left

Fork:

    Alwas starts with if(condition) where the condition could be
    "FieldIs~" or "FieldIsNot~". The color replaced by ~.
    Always ends with fi.
    If the condition is true, the bot execute the code
    between if(condition) and fi.
    Example:

       if(FieldIsRed)
           turn(left)
       fi

    in this example, if the bot is on a red field, than it turns left

Loops:

    Always ends with endloop.

    while(condition):
       The bot execute the code between while(condition) and endloop
       while the condition is true. The condition could be  "FieldIs~" , "FieldIsNot~" or "true".
       The color replaced by ~. If the condition is "true", than the condition always be true, 
       so it will be an endless loop.
       Example:

          while(FieldIsNotGreen)
             move()
          endloop

       in this example, while the bot doesn't step on a green field, it goes ahead.

    for(number):

       The bot execute the code between for(number) and endloop number times.
       If you don't write any number in the brackets, it will be an endless loop.
       Example:

          for(3)
             move()
          endloop

       in this example the bot goes ahead 3 times.

Colors:
    - Red
    - Green
    - Cyan(The goal position)
    - Blue
    - Yellow
    - Gray

Functions:

    You can write functions to Function1 and Function2 testareas. If the textarea is gray,
    than you can't write in it, but there can be code what you can use but can't change.
    You can use functions in any function with function1() and function2() code words.
    Example: 

      Main:
        function1()
       
      Function1:
         if(FieldIsNotRed)
            move()
            function1()
         fi

     in this example the bot goes ahead while it doesn't step on a red field.
